Intermittent execution using tasks and dynamic allocation of memory to per-task
write after read buffers and transaction buffers.

Based on libchain (A. Colin) code and ideas from alpaca (K. Maeng)

To show communication activity over channels using printf,
define the following flag when compiling libchain *and*
the application:

    make LIBCHAIN_ENABLE_DIAGNOSTICS=1

The following variables need to be configured to manage Buffi's buffering
protocol.

These determine the different buffer sizes
export LIBCOATIGCC_PER_TSK_BUF_SIZE = 300
export LIBCOATIGCC_CTX_BUF_SIZE = 500

export LIBCOATIGCC_TX_BUF_SIZE = 500
export LIBCOATIGCC_PER_TX_DIRTY_ENTRIES = 500
export LIBCOATIGCC_NUM_WRITE_ENTRIES = 3000

These decide if we're using atomics and if the interrupt flag will be tracked in
software (so we can count how many times it fires vs how many times we run the
interrupt) or if it'll just be tracked in the ISR vector in the MCU's memory
export LIBCOATIGCC_ENABLE_ATOMICS ?= 0
export LIBCOATIGCC_ATOMICS_HW ?= 0

These decide if we're using buffered or split phase serialization (when
BUFFER_ALL = 1 we're in buffered, o/w we're in split phase) and if we are in
buffered, CHECK_ALL_TX makes better use of our write list memory by checking
through all of the addresses already in the buffer rather than just
concatenating the new write to the end of the list (which can result in extra
memory usage but is substantially faster).
export LIBCOATIGCC_CHECK_ALL_TX ?= 0
export LIBCOATIGCC_BUFFER_ALL ?= 1



The following variables need to be configured if you want to do specific
profiling on Coati apps
# This group is 1 hot... do yourself a favor and don't set more than one.
export LIBCOATIGCC_TIME_TEST ?= 0
export LIBCOATIGCC_COUNT_TEST ?= 0
export LIBCOATIGCC_TIME_EV ?= 0
export LIBCOATIGCC_TIME_TX ?= 0
export LIBCOATIGCC_HIST_SIZE ?= 0
export LIBCOATIGCC_WAIT_TEST ?= 0

# These aren't quite one-hot. You need deferred count set to 1 and either ev or
# tsk def count set... come to think of it, that may not quite work for events
# just yet, but if you set both you'll get everything, and if they're both 0
# while deferred count is 1, you get just the tx def stuff if we're buffering
# all
export LIBCOATIGCC_DEFERRED_COUNT_TEST ?= 0
export LIBCOATIGCC_TSK_DEF_COUNT ?= 0
export LIBCOATIGCC_EV_DEF_COUNT ?= 0
